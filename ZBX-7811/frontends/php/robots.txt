# If Zabbix frontend is available on the internet, it is suggested to disallow
# access to it for the robots (like search engine crawlers), otherwise they
# may overload Zabbix system without offering any benefit.
#
# Note that this should not be used for security reasons, as any visitor is
# free to ignore contents of this file (or use them to know which directories
# are supposed to be hidden).
#
# The example configuration below will disallow any robot access if Zabbix
# frontend is in the root directory.

User-agent: *
Disallow: /

# If Zabbix frontend is in a subdirectory - for example, 'zabbix' - this file
# should be placed in the root directory of web documents directory and path to
# subdirectory should be specified like this instead:
# Disallow: /zabbix/

# Event-Driven Ansible webhook

This guide describes how to integrate your Zabbix 8.0 installation with Event-Driven Ansible using the Zabbix webhook feature. This guide will provide instructions on setting up a media type, a user and an action in Zabbix.

## Setting up Event-Driven Ansible Webhook

1\. Make sure you have the webhook plugin loaded from the standard ansible collection (ansible.eda.webhook) and use ansible-rulebook v0.11.0 and higher.

2\. Create a rulebook and specify a webhook from the standard eda collection (ansible.eda.webhook) as the event source. Specify listen address, port and token.
```
sources:
  - ansible.eda.webhook:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 5001
      token: example
```
3\. Set necessary actions in the rules section. As an example you can use:
```
---
- name: Zabbix Test rulebook
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.webhook:
        host: 0.0.0.0
        port: 5001
        token: example
  rules:
    - name: debug
      condition: event.payload is defined
      action:
        debug:
```

4\. For testing you can run ansible-rulebook with command:
```
ansible-rulebook --rulebook test-rulebook.yml -i inventory.yml --verbose
```
> Note: before starting, make sure that the eda-server is running and you are in the eda-server virtual environment


## Setting up Zabbix Webhook

The configuration consists of a _media type_ in Zabbix which will invoke a webhook to send alerts to Event-Driven Ansible.
To utilize the media type, you need to create a Zabbix user to represent Event-Driven Ansible. Then, create an alert action to notify the user via this media type whenever a problem is detected.

> Note: only trigger-based and only problem events are currently supported

## Create the Event-Driven Ansible media type

1\. In the *Alerts* menu section, select *Media types*.

2\. Click on the **Import** button in the upper right corner.

3\. Select the file [media_event_driven_ansible.yaml](media_event_driven_ansible.yaml) and press **Import** at the bottom.

## Create the Event-Driven Ansible user for alerting

1\. In the *Users* menu section, select *Users*.

2\. Click on the **Create user** button in the upper right corner. Fill in the details of this new user.

> Please note: in order to be notified of host problems this user must have at least read permissions for the given host.

3\. Navigate to the **Media** tab and click on the **Add** button inside of the Media box.

4\. Configure the media type:
 - Set *Type* to *Event-Driven Ansible*.
 - In the *Send to* field, specify the IP address and destination port in the format `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port`.
 - In the *token* field, specify the token used for authentication.
 - Press Add to save the media type.

5\. Press Add in the User configuration form to save the user.

> Note: Because each new rulebook requires a separate port, you have to create a separate user for each rulebook, specifying the ip:port and token.

6\. Use Event-Driven Ansible user in any [actions](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/8.0/manual/config/notifications/action) of your choice.

7\. Start getting alerts! You have made it!

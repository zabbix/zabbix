# Chassis by IPMI

## Overview

Template for monitoring servers with BMC over IPMI that work without any external scripts.
All metrics are collected at once, thanks to Zabbix's bulk data collection.
It collects metrics by polling BMC remotely using an IPMI agent.

###Known Issues

- Description: If the BMC has a sensor with an empty threshold value, we get the LLD error "Cannot create trigger...".


## Requirements

Zabbix version: 7.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- HP iLO, DELL DRAC, IBM RSA

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/7.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

You can set {$IPMI.USER} and {$IPMI.PASSWORD} macros in the template for using on the host level.


### Macros used

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|{$IPMI.USER}|<p>This macro is used for access to BMC. It can be overridden on the host or linked template level.</p>||
|{$IPMI.PASSWORD}|<p>This macro is used for access to BMC. It can be overridden on the host or linked template level.</p>||
|{$IPMI.SENSOR_TYPE.MATCHES}|<p>This macro is used in sensors discovery. It can be overridden on the host or linked template level.</p>|`.*`|
|{$IPMI.SENSOR_TYPE.NOT_MATCHES}|<p>This macro is used in sensors discovery. It can be overridden on the host or linked template level.</p>|`invalid`|

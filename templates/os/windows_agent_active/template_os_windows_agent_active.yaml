            Page Faults/sec is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in number of pages
            faulted per second because only one page is faulted in each fault operation, hence this is also equal
            to the number of page fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that require
            disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most
            processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults,
            which require disk access, can cause significant delays.

            Processor DPC time is the time that a single processor spent receiving and servicing deferred procedure

            component of % Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode. If a high % DPC Time is
            sustained, there may be a processor bottleneck or an application or hardware related issue that can
            significantly diminish overall system performance.

            Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.
            Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.
            It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.
            There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.

                    This trigger expression works as follows:
                    1. Can be triggered if operations status is down.
                    2. {$IFCONTROL:\"{#IFNAME}\"}=1 - user can redefine Context macro to value - 0. That marks this interface as not important.
                        No new trigger will be fired if this interface is down.
                    3. {TEMPLATE_NAME:METRIC.diff()}=1) - trigger fires only if operational status is different from Connected(2).
                    
                    WARNING: if closed manually - won't fire again on next poll, because of .diff.

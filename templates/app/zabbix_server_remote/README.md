# Remote Zabbix server health

## Overview

This template is designed to monitor internal Zabbix metrics on the remote Zabbix server.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 7.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- Zabbix server 7.0

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/7.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

Specify the address of the remote Zabbix server by changing `{$ZABBIX.SERVER.ADDRESS}` and `{$ZABBIX.SERVER.PORT}` macros. Don't forget to adjust the `StatsAllowedIP` parameter in the remote server's configuration file to allow the collection of statistics.

### Macros used

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|{$ZABBIX.SERVER.ADDRESS}|<p>IP/DNS/network mask list of servers to be remotely queried (default is 127.0.0.1).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.SERVER.PORT}|<p>Port of server to be remotely queried (default is 10051).</p>||
|{$PROXY.LAST_SEEN.MAX}|<p>The maximum number of seconds that Zabbix proxy has not been seen.</p>|`600`|
|{$ZABBIX.SERVER.NODATA_TIMEOUT}|<p>The time threshold after which statistics are considered unavailable. Used in trigger expression.</p>|`5m`|

# Zabbix proxy health

## Overview

This template is designed to monitor internal Zabbix metrics on the local Zabbix proxy.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 8.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- Zabbix proxy 8.0

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/8.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

Link this template to the local Zabbix proxy host.

# Remote Zabbix proxy health

## Overview

This template is designed to monitor internal Zabbix metrics on the remote Zabbix proxy.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 8.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- Zabbix proxy 8.0

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/8.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

Specify the address of the remote Zabbix proxy by updating the `{$ZABBIX.PROXY.ADDRESS}` and `{$ZABBIX.PROXY.PORT}` macros. Don't forget to adjust the `StatsAllowedIP` parameter in the remote proxy's configuration file to allow the collection of statistics.

### Macros used

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.ADDRESS}|<p>IP/DNS of the remote Zabbix proxy (default is 127.0.0.1).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.PORT}|<p>Port of the remote Zabbix proxy (default is 10051).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.UTIL.MIN}|<p>Default minimum threshold for percentage utilization triggers (use macro context for specification).</p>|`65`|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.UTIL.MAX}|<p>Default maximum threshold for percentage utilization triggers (use macro context for specification).</p>|`75`|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.NODATA_TIMEOUT}|<p>The time threshold after which statistics are considered unavailable. Used in trigger expressions.</p>|`5m`|

# Zabbix proxy health by Zabbix agent

## Overview

This template is designed to monitor internal Zabbix metrics on the remote Zabbix proxy via the passive Zabbix agent.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 8.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- Zabbix proxy 8.0

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/8.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

Specify the address of the remote Zabbix proxy by changing the `{$ZABBIX.PROXY.ADDRESS}` and `{$ZABBIX.PROXY.PORT}` macros. Don't forget to adjust the `StatsAllowedIP` parameter in the remote proxy's configuration file to allow the collection of statistics.

### Macros used

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.ADDRESS}|<p>IP/DNS of the remote Zabbix proxy (default is 127.0.0.1).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.PORT}|<p>Port of the remote Zabbix proxy (default is 10051).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.UTIL.MIN}|<p>Default minimum threshold for percentage utilization triggers (use macro context for specification).</p>|`65`|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.UTIL.MAX}|<p>Default maximum threshold for percentage utilization triggers (use macro context for specification).</p>|`75`|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.NODATA_TIMEOUT}|<p>The time threshold after which statistics are considered unavailable. Used in trigger expressions.</p>|`5m`|

# Zabbix proxy health by Zabbix agent active

## Overview

This template is designed to monitor internal Zabbix metrics on the remote Zabbix proxy via the active Zabbix agent.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 8.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- Zabbix proxy 8.0

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/8.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

Specify the address of the remote Zabbix proxy by changing the `{$ZABBIX.PROXY.ADDRESS}` and `{$ZABBIX.PROXY.PORT}` macros. Don't forget to adjust the `StatsAllowedIP` parameter in the remote proxy's configuration file to allow the collection of statistics.

### Macros used

|Name|Description|Default|
|----|-----------|-------|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.ADDRESS}|<p>IP/DNS of the remote Zabbix proxy (default is 127.0.0.1).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.PORT}|<p>Port of the remote Zabbix proxy (default is 10051).</p>||
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.UTIL.MIN}|<p>Default minimum threshold for percentage utilization triggers (use macro context for specification).</p>|`65`|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.UTIL.MAX}|<p>Default maximum threshold for percentage utilization triggers (use macro context for specification).</p>|`75`|
|{$ZABBIX.PROXY.NODATA_TIMEOUT}|<p>The time threshold after which statistics are considered unavailable. Used in trigger expressions.</p>|`5m`|

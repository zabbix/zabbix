# Interfaces Simple by SNMP

## Overview

### Known Issues

Description: 32bit counters are used in this template (since there is no ifXtable available). If busy interfaces return incorrect bits sent/received - set update interval to 1m or less.

## Requirements

Zabbix version: 6.0 and higher.

## Tested versions

This template has been tested on:
- Interfaces SNMP

## Configuration

> Zabbix should be configured according to the instructions in the [Templates out of the box](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/6.0/manual/config/templates_out_of_the_box) section.

## Setup

Refer to the vendor documentation.

	 *                                                                         *
	 * Due to the way Windows API functions report memory metrics,             *
	 * it is impossible to accurately retrieve swap (virtual memory)           *
	 * sizes as Windows reports the total commit memory which is physical      *
	 * memory plus swap file sizes. The only resolution that could be applied  *
	 * was calculatively deducting the swap sizes knowing the page and         *
	 * physical memory sizes.                                                  *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * While developing this solution, it was found that sometimes (in         *
	 * virtualized environments or when page file is disabled) the calculated  *
	 * swap values are outside of possible bounds. For example, the available  *
	 * swap size may appear to be larger than the total swap memory size of    *
	 * the system, or even the calculated swap sizes may result in negative    *
	 * values (in system with disabled page file).                             *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * Taking these fallacious conditions into account, these calculations     *
	 * guarantee that the available swap size is never larger than the total   *
	 * available (if it is reported as such, it is lowered to the total        *
	 * as there is a higher probability of that number staying consistent      *
	 * than the other way around). In case of swap size calculations resulting *
	 * in negative values, the corresponding values are set to 0.              *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * As the result the returned values might not be exactly accurate         *
	 * depending on the system and environment, but they ought to be close     *
	 * enough.                                                                 *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * NB: The reason why GlobalMemoryStatus[Ex] are used is their             *
	 * availability on Windows 2000 and later, as opposed to other functions   *
	 * of a similar nature (like GetPerformanceInfo) that are not supported    *
	 * on some versions of Windows.                                            *
	 *                                                                         *

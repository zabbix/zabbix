	 *                                                                         *
	 * Due to the way Windows API functions report memory metrics,             *
	 * it is impossible to accurately retrieve swap (virtual memory)           *
	 * sizes as Windows either does not report them properly or                *
	 * reports swap along with actual physical memory as page file             *
	 * sizes. The only resolution that could be applied was calculatively      *
	 * deducting the swap sizes knowing the page and physical memory           *
	 * sizes.                                                                  *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * While developing this solution, it was found that in virtualized        *
	 * environments Windows reports incorrect values for various memory        *
	 * types. For example, the free memory size may be larger than the         *
	 * total memory size of the system, or, under certain circumstances,       *
	 * these functions may return negative values.                             *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * Taking these fallacious conditions into account, these calculations     *
	 * guarantee that the available swap size is never larger than the total   *
	 * available (if it is reported as such, it is lowered to the total        *
	 * as there is a higher probability of that number staying consistent      *
	 * than the other way around). In case of the system reporting negative    *
	 * values, the appropriate metric is returned as 0.                        *
	 *                                                                         *
	 * The returned values are not guaranteed to be accurate and may report    *
	 * inaccurate results which may depend on the system and environment.      *
	 * In a proper system environment, this should logically work just as any  *
	 * arithmetic calculation, but the problem lies within the way Windows     *
	 * itself operates. Although this guestimate should work most of the time, *
	 * there are no guarantees that it will.                                   *
	 *                                                                         *

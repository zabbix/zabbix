Description: network monitoring solution - agent
 Zabbix is a server/client network monitoring system with many features.
 It can be used for:
 .
  - high level monitoring of IT services;
  - centralized monitoring of your servers and applications;
  - monitoring of SNMP-enabled devices;
  - performance monitoring (process load, network activity, disk
    activity, memory usage, OS parameters etc.);
  - data visualization.
 .
 This package provides the software needed to integrate a host as a Zabbix
 client.

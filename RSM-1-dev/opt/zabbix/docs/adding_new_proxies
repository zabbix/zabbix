Adding new probes to Zabbix installation

1. Install new probe server using "proxy_install" documentation.

2. Do not forget to add Zabbix proxy port (10051 TCP) to allow incoming packets from Zabbix server.

3. Do not forget to add Zabbix agent port (10050 TCP) to allow communication from Zabbix server to Zabbix agent.

4. Go to Zabbix frontend. Go to Administration->DM page and select "Proxies" in the dropbox menu right top corner.

5. Click "Create proxy" button.

6. Fill "Proxy name" field with name of new proxy.

7. Proxy mode must be "Passive".

8. Fill "Interface" section with IP, DNS and port settings. Connection to proxy using IP is preffered than using DNS.

9. CLick "Save". Proxy is added.

This directory holds Zabbix translations and helper scripts to work with them.

If you have checked out this copy of frontend from svn and want to access
 translations, run make_mo.sh .

Working msgfmt and find are required. This script will generate mo files for all
 translations.

If you want to update po files with new strings in the sourcefile, run
 update_po.sh . It will gather translatable strings from all files that end with
 ".php"

If you want to start translating in a new language, run add_new_language.sh and
 pass language code as the only argument, for example:

  $ ./add_new_language.sh et

It's important to check and make sure that "Plural-Forms" value is set correctly.

For this script language template is needed. Running update_po.sh will generate
 one as frontend.pot (which add_new_language.sh requires).

After new language po file has been created, need to add the language codes to 
 PHP code in include/locales.inc.php file.

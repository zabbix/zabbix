An enterprise-class, open-source distributed monitoring solution that’s designed to monitor the performance and availability of network devices, servers, services, and other IT resources.
Zabbix is a flexible solution that can monitor anything from a simple, standalone application to a large-scale environment, with features including:

- **Resource discovery:** Discover network entities, server resources, and onboard/offboard devices. Use out-of-the-box integrations (templates) to monitor anything form a low-level device to a SAAS service.
- **Metric acquisition:** Use an agent or agent-less approach for metric acquisition from any source – devices, sensors, operating systems, virtualization platforms, container platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructures, databases, webpages, Java ecosystems, application servers, API endpoints, business applications, and many more.
- **Root cause analysis and problem detection:** Count on high-performance, real-time problem detection that correlates both existing and incoming problems and performs root cause analyses.
- **Incidents, alerts, and notifications:** Receive an alert when an issue is triggered (proactively or post-mortem) in the ecosystem. Use multiple messaging channels (including Slack, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, email or text messages) to get notified about the different types of events occurring in your environment.
- **“Single pane of glass” overview:** Visualize collected data and monitoring events in graphs, lists, geomaps, and network topology maps.
- **Multitenancy and distributed monitoring:** Enjoy the convenience of one monitoring solution for multiple data centers, departments, and organizations, and monitor remote locations behind firewalls with remote command execution capability.
- **Unparalleled flexibility:** Adapt Zabbix to your needs and utilize built-in functionalities, including the ability to stream metrics and events over HTTP, reporting, auditing, security, service SLA calculations, and many more.

## Try Zabbix in a Virtual Environment

If you are a new to Zabbix, you can practice using it by installing in an isolated environment like a virtual box in your local computer. First you have to install a virtual box and install an operating system like Ubuntu with a graphical UI. Note the OS version so you can download the relevant zabbix version for your Operating System. For example, you can install Oracle virtual box and install latest ubuntu version with a GUI on it. 
Oracle Virtual Box 👉 [Download oracle virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) <br>
Ubuntu Desktop 👉 [Download Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

**Install Zabbix Server in Ubuntu**

When you have configured your virtual environment, you can start installing Zabbix Server in ubuntu desktop. For that, you have to select the relevant zabbix package from the website.

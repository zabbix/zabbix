    shortDescription: Zabbix is an enterprise-grade monitoring and observability platform
    longDescription: >-
      Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution
      designed to monitor and track performance and availability of network
      servers, devices, services and other IT resources.


      Zabbix is an all-in-one monitoring solution that allows users to collect,
      store, manage and analyze information received from IT infrastructure, as
      well as display on-screen, and alert by e-mail, SMS or Jabber when
      thresholds are reached.


      Zabbix allows administrators to recognize server and device problems
      within a short period of time and therefore reduces the system downtime
      and risk of system failure. The monitoring solution is being actively used
      by SMBs and large enterprises across all industries and almost in every
      country of the world.

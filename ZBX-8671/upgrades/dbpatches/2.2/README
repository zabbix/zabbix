Database upgrade
----------------

Zabbix server performs automatic database upgrade starting from version 2.2.0.
No SQL scripts are provided anymore.

----------------

Starting with 2.2.0, manual database patching is not required anymore. Zabbix
 server and proxy processes automatically check and upgrade the database schema
 and relevant data.

Patching status and progress is visible in the logfile.

Note that upgrade will be always started unconditionally, care should be taken
 when starting new binaries to prevent undesired database changes.

Warning: make sure to have database backup before starting the new binaries.

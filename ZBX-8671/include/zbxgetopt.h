/* Describe the long-named options requested by the application.
   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector
   of `struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is
   zero.

   The field `has_arg' is:
   no_argument          (or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
   required_argument    (or 1) if the option requires an argument,
   optional_argument    (or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

   If the field `flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
   to the value given in the field `val' when the option is found, but
   left unchanged if the option is not found.

   To have a long-named option do something other than set an `int' to
   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from `optarg', set the
   option's `flag' field to zero and its `val' field to a non-zero
   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
   one).  For long options that have a zero `flag' field, `getopt'
   returns the contents of the `val' field.  */
